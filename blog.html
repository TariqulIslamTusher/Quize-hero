                  Write down the difference between map()/ filter()/ find() and forEach() methode?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p>JavaScript Provide different methodes to loop through an Array and Object. Out of these For loop is the most popular methode, but other then this there are some other methode like forEach() / map() methode to loop through an array. Returning the value after looping is the main difference between of forEach and map methode. filter method is also use in js array or object for filtering the element under condition. And find is the things for which we can search on an array or object with specific credentials or conditions.</p> <br>
                  <p>Above mentioned methodes and its features are listed below :</p>
                  <h3>Features of map() methode</h3>

                        <li>map() creates a new array</li>
                        <li>map() does not change the original array</li>
                        <li>map() returns value which creates a new array</li>
                        <li>map() is an ES6 features</li>
                        <li>map() is used to iterate over every element on array</li>
                        <li>map() is use when same action is need in every elements of an collection</li>
                      </ul>
                  </div> <br>

                        <li>filter() return an array which stays beyond condition</li>
                        <li>filter() can run both on array and object</li>
                        <li>filter() methode pass a callback function which select the passed element to make a new array</li>
                        <li>filter() methode need a variable to store its returns data</li>
                      </ul>
                  </div> <br>
                  <h3>Features of find() methode</h3>

                        <li>find() methode returns the element on the given condition</li>
                        <li>find() methode find the element on condition that passes the test</li>
                        <li>find() methode use to aquir the element that meets the given criteria</li>
                        <li>find() methode can be used both in array and in object</li>
                      </ul>

                        <li>forEach() is also an iterativ methode</li>
                        <li>forEach() methode only used in array</li>
                        <li>forEach() always returns undefined</li>
                        <li>forEach() can also used as for loop storing into a variable</li>
                        <li>forEach() may not change the original array</li>

                  What is the difference between LocalStorage, SessionStorage and Cookies?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p><span class="font-bold">LocalStorage :  </span>
                    Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Local storage is now highly using by different e-commers websites and applications. Genarally it is more visible once logged in website used some local storage for every user to store data for better experience. These data doesnt removed without coading or break off the loging site as well as the hardware.There is no expiration date for the data kept in local storage.The storage limitation is approximately 10MB.Data from local storage is never sent to the server.
                    </p><br>

                  <p><span class="font-bold">SessionStorage :  </span>
                    The localStorage and the sessionStorage are extremely similar. However, the limitation of session storage is its information stays in the browserâ€”until the current tab or session is active. The data stored in session storage is also deleted when the tab of browser or the site break off or closed. 
                    </p><br>

                  <p><span class="font-bold">Cookies :  </span>
                    Cookies assist us in storing client-side data to provide website visitors with a customized experience. Cookies are transmitted to the server along with requests and returned back to the client in response; as a result, the server and client exchange cookie data with each request. The servers could deliver users tailored content using the cookie data.

                  What does you mean by Event loop?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p>Event loop is a javaScript runtiome model which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and proccesing the events and executing queued sub-tasks. It is the secretes behing javaScript's asynchornous programming. JavaScript execute all operations in a sigle thread, but using a few data structure it gives the illusion of multi-threading experience. In imagination Event loop is held by a call stack , a event queue and a broser api. Event queue sends the operators or functions in the stack on fill basis, when the stack is empty the event queue again sent the function maintaining the sequence of the code. Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Here the browser api sent as a seperate threads. It runs the async function in the single thread. As example 'setTimeOut' method. when a 'setTimeOut' methode run into a stack, it sends to its corresponding API's and wait till the specified time to send the function back in the stack to oparate again. </p>

                  Describe the operations of quizeTimer Functions?

                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p>The function quizTimer is declared in noChange.js file where it declare with one perameter, that means it will take only one argument, and seems like argument will be boolean value. If the argument is true the quizTimer will stop the timer executing in the innerText of ID 'count' . The innerText of id 'count' is also made dynamic by quizTimer function. timer variable holding the setInterval function that changing the innerText of 'count' in every second and dynamically making its as minutes and seconds in two decimal number. And mentioned function also make the innerText of id 'count' into red-700 after passing the 60 sec of the quiz test. In the index.js file we can observe that the quizTimer function called in two place on condition where on is getting argument as true and the other is as null ,hence false value.</p>

                  <p>chooseQuize function execute the slection of the option in each quize and display it inside the displayResult div. chooseQuize function is declared on the noChange.js file and it is calling inside the displayQuizOptions function where it is getting two argument as it declared as being two perameters holders. There the first argument is the id number , and the second argument is deployed as the array. When the array is go through a loop for every element with condition the answer array is replaced by the givenAns by splice() methode where serial number value is 0, and the number of delete count remain 1, that means only one element remain finally in the array . Here , declared a variable called isExist which will be true or false depends on the finding on the answer array. if the variable isExist exist then it will go through the condition of forEach and serial++ and answer.splice().
